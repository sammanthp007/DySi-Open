# DySi Open
DySi Open uses Dynamic Signals open apis.

## Tasks
- [x] Create a new empty project in Xcode.
- [x] Setup Git for this project and link it to your personal account, make a
  first commit.
- [x] Using a framework of your choosing (native or 3rd party), make a call to
  [Dynamic Signals public api](https://www.dysiopen.com/v1/posts/public). The
  response will be a JSON array of post objects. You can see what these objects
  look like [here](https://dev.voicestorm.com/api/responses/postResponse).
- [ ] Using Texture framework, render the following for each post:
    - [ ] author (including profile image if it exists)
    - [ ] title
    - [ ] description
    - [ ] creation date
    - [ ] post’s image (if exists in the “media” array)
- [ ] Clicking on each post should open the post’s "permalink” in a webView.
 
## Bonus (Nice to have features):-
- [ ] Implement pull-to-refresh.
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for the server response.
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for images.

> Feel free to surprise us with anything cool you can do to this project.

Here’s how are we going to assess the project:-

- Having a **well thought design** for your code, that is **maintainable**,
  **testable** & **clear**.
- **Documented methods**, variable & class names that are meaningful.
- A good commit history.
- A neat UI that should look decent and work on **different screen sizes** +
  **landscape mode**.

You are welcome to use as many 3rd party libraries/pods as you wish.
